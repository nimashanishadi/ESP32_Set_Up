# ESP32_Set_Up
This repository is mainly designed to guide users through the step-by-step setup of the ESP32 and configuration of the ESP-IDF Toolkit for  Channel State Information (CSI) data collection. Channel State Information provides fine-grained metrics of the wireless communication channel, which can be used in applications such as localization, motion detection, and network diagnostics.

The ESP32 microcontroller is a very powerful board that has built-in wireless capabilities and is a very good platform to explore applications using CSI. This repository provides examples of how to configure an ESP32 device for capturing CSI data, its processing, and usage for different use cases.

# CSI data
Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) provides the fine-grained information on the wireless communication channel by capturing signal properties such as amplitude and phase for each subcarrier in a Wi-Fi transmission. CSI reflects how signals propagate through the environment, accounting for phenomena like scattering, fading, and signal attenuation. 

This fine-grained information enables applications such as human activity recognition, indoor localization, gesture recognition, and network performance analysis. By studying CSI, one will be able to monitor changes in the environment, trace devices, and improve systems of wireless communication, thereby becoming an asset in research and practical applications.

# ESP32 microcontroller
ESP32 is a System-on-Chip (SoC) that combines Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz band) and Bluetooth 4.2 solutions on one chip, along with dual high-performance cores, an Ultra-Low-Power co-processor, and several peripherals. Powered by advanced 40 nm technology, ESP32 provides a robust, highly integrated platform to meet the growing demands for efficient power usage, compact design, security, high performance, and reliability.

Moreover, Espressif, the company behind ESP32, offers all sorts of hardware and software resources to help developers build new and innovative IoT applications. It provides a software development framework with tools to develop IoT solutions—equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, power management, and system optimization features—rapidly.
